# Endangered Species World Map

## Description

_This page was developed as an assignment for the Episodus CSS class. The assignment goal was to practice positioning and styling. The site wasn't built with mobile devices in mind._
_The site displays the position of endangered species around the world. The user can click on the animal picture to select the animal and read more information about it.
When the animal picture gets clicked, it gets moved to the center of the page, the image gets enlarged, the common and scientific name of the species get displayed, and the other elements on the page get blurred._
